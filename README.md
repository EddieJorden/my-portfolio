My Portfolio

This is a portfolio for Eddie Moger who is a software developer out of Sunnyvale CA.

This portfolio has been created to introduce you to Eddie Moger.

This project was built using JavaScript with React.js, as well as styled components.

Some of the challenges I faced building this application was the overall planning and structure.

Installation:
    you will need to have a javascript developement enviroment setup on your machine to run this locally.

    this link will take you through the steps.
    https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/

    when you are ready to run the app you will need to fork this repository from:
    https://github.com/EddieJorden/my-portfolio

    and clone it to your local machine using
    git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/my-portfolio

    once installed on your local machine navigate to the directory you savaed it to and type
    npm start or yarn start if you are using yarn

    if all has gone as expected the app should start up in a development server on your local machine

How To
    This is built mostly using only flexbox,  each section of the app is a box that renders based on @media.  The structure is modular and adjusts and arranges itself with out the need for individual css changes.
    
    the content window displays the Component passed into updateDisplayContent
    example:
    updateDisplayedContent(<ReachComponentToDisplay />)

    MyProjectsArray is a mock back end api, the data is then used throughout the app.

    NavButton is a modular button used with data being passed in throughout the app.

    CompenentDiv is a modular component div providing consistent css throughout the app.
